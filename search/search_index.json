Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is governed by Newton's laws and kinematics. The equations of motion for a projectile launched with initial velocity v\u2080 at an angle \u03b8 are: Equations of Motion Horizontal Motion: x(t) = v\u2080 * cos(\u03b8) * t Vertical Motion: y(t) = v\u2080 * sin(\u03b8) * t - (1/2) * g * t\u00b2 where: - x(t), y(t) are positions at time t. - v\u2080 is initial velocity. - \u03b8 is the launch angle. - g is gravitational acceleration. Family of Solutions Varying \u03b8 changes the projectile's path. The maximum range occurs at 45\u00b0 under ideal conditions. \"\"\" import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def projectile_range(v0, theta, g=9.81): \"\"\"Computes the projectile range given initial velocity and angle.\"\"\" return (v0 ** 2) * np.sin(2 * np.radians(theta)) / g Parameters v0 = 20 # Initial velocity in m/s theta_values = np.linspace(0, 90, 100) ranges = [projectile_range(v0, theta) for theta in theta_values] Plot 2. Analysis of the Range The horizontal range R of a projectile is given by: R = (v\u2080\u00b2 * sin(2\u03b8)) / g Influence of Parameters: Angle of Projection: Maximum range at 45\u00b0. Initial Velocity: Higher v\u2080 increases range quadratically. Gravity: Stronger g reduces range. 3. Practical Applications Ballistics: Predicting projectile paths in sports and military. Engineering: Estimating projectile impacts in structures. Astrophysics: Orbital insertions with gravity variations. 4. Limitations & Extensions Limitations Ignores air resistance, wind, and spin. Assumes uniform gravity. Extensions Incorporate drag force using differential equations. Model wind influence and terrain effects. 5. Results The generated plot \"projectile_range_plot.png\" is saved and can be used for analysis. Conclusion This study explored projectile motion theoretically and computationally. The idealized model provides insights into motion principles, with potential refinements for real-world accuracy. \"\"\"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"\"\"\"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#analysis-and-simulation-of-projectile-motion","text":"","title":"Analysis and Simulation of Projectile Motion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-theoretical-foundation","text":"Projectile motion is governed by Newton's laws and kinematics.
